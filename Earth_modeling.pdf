\textbf{Declination:} The angle between the direction of the compass and the true direction of the north. \\*
\textbf{Inclination:} The vertical angle between the north and the direction the compass points when it is suspended in free fall.\\*
\textbf{Magnetic poles:} Positions on Earth's Surface for where the horizontal component of the magnetic field is 0. \\*
\textbf{Magnetic Equator:} An undulating curve near the Earth's geographical equator where the vertical component of the magnetic field is 0. \\*

Before modeling the Earth as a magnetic dipole, it is best to define a few terminologies about magnetic dipole, which is the first order approximation of the Earth's magnetic field.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Magnetic Dipole:} A pair of South and North magnetic poles kept closed together or viewed from a large distance. More formally, it is the limit of either a closed loop of electric current or a pair of poles as the dimensions of the source are reduced to zero while keeping the magnetic moment constant.
\item \textbf{Magnetic Dipole Moment:} A quantity that represents the magnetic field strength and orientation of a magnet or other objects that produces a magnetic field. 
\item \textbf{Magnetic Vector Potential ($\vec{A}$):} It is a vector field that serves as the potential for magnetic field. The curl of the magnetic field potential is the magnetic field.
\begin{center}
	$\vec{B} = \nabla \times \vec{A} $
\end{center}

\end{enumerate}


\section{Magnetic field as Dipole }
We are able to write the Earth's magnetic pole by modeling it according to a dipole - a first order approximation.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:t}
	\begin{gathered} 
\textbf{B(r)} = (B_r, B_\theta, B_\phi)\\ 
	\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\indent When we align the Earth's magnetic field along the z-axis:
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
	V(\textbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi r^3} m \cdot r\\
	= \frac{mr\cos(\theta)}{4\pi r^3}\\
	= \frac{m\cos(\theta)}{4\pi r^2}	
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\indent We can derive three equations separately for $B_r$, $B_\theta$, and $B_\phi$, stated as the following. We fine $\textbf{m}$ as the dipole moment, and $\mu_o$ as the vacuum permeability. 

\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
B_r(r,\theta,\phi) = \frac{-2\mu_omcos(\theta)}{4\pi r^3}\\
B_\theta(r,\theta,\phi) = \frac{-\mu_omcos(\theta)}{4\pi r^3}\\
B_\phi(r,\theta,\phi) = 0
	\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
\indent Thus the total field, which is just the vector sum of the three $B$ functions. 

\begin{equation}
B(r, \theta, \phi) = \sqrt{B_r^2+B_\theta^2+B_\phi^2} = \frac{\mu_o m}{4\pi r^3} \sqrt{1+3cos^2(\theta)}
\end{equation}
\begin{center}
At the \textbf{North Pole}
\end{center}
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
B_r(r,\theta,\phi) = \frac{-\mu_omcos(\theta)}{2\pi r^3}\\
B_\theta(r,\theta,\phi) = 0
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	At the \textbf{Magnetic Equator}
\end{center}
\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
B_r(r,\theta,\phi) = 0\\
B_\theta(r,\theta,\phi) = \frac{-\mu_omcos(\theta)}{4\pi r^3}
	\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
Let's define $$k_o = \frac{\mu_o \textit{m}}{4\pi}$$
and we know that at the Earth's Dipole $k_o = 8 * 10^{15} \hspace{0.1cm} Tm^3$\\
At the dipole, $\theta = \pm 90^{\circ} $, and we return the value of B as $B = \frac{2k_o}{R_E^3} \approx 60 \mu T$ \\
At the dipole, $\theta = \pm 0^{\circ} $, and we return the value of B as $B = \frac{k_o}{R_E^3} \approx 30 \mu T$\\
\newline
Conceptually, Earth's magnetic field does not lie directly on the north and south pole and is not necessarily antipodal. The best fit dipole currently is 11.5$^{\circ}$ from the geographical north pole.
